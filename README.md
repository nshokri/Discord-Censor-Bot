# Discord-Censor-Bot
This discord bot helps keep your discord clean from explicit/NSFW images. It utilizes Microsoft Azure's computer vision endpoint to determine properties about the image and will remove any images deemed racy.

# Note
You will need to have your own Azure account and project set up for this bot to work. You will also need to add environmental vars that contain your account/project credentials.
